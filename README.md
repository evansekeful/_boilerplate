_boilerplate

A Work in Progress

TODO

* Validate functionality of upgraded dependencies
* Add Modernizr Build to gulpfile
* Pipe plugins.js in gulpfile
* Add Babel to gulpfile
* Add package title to header
* Add nodemon to gulpfile
* Write vendor paths to index in gulpfile for easy version updates
* Add Google snippet to Gulp with code in package.json
* Update dependency install instructions to README

## Requirements
To start using this boilerplate template, you will need the following:
### Node.js
TODO: Add install instructions.
### Gulp
TODO: Add install instructions.
## Usage
This is a simple and slightly opinionated static HTML site boilerplate template built to use Gulp, Bootstrap, and SASS. Template gulpfiles are available for standard use cases by yours truly.

1. Fork repo and copy into new development folder.
2. (Optional) Update gulpfile with appropriate template.
3. Update package.json with project information.
4. (Optional) Update favicon in img folder with your own branding.
5. Start developing your static site. :)
